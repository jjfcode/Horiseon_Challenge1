## Description

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards<br>
WHEN I view the source code<br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements<br>
<ul>
    <li>Change the div with class header for a Header element, inside the header and a nav.</li>
    <li>Change the div class hero for a figure element.</li>
    <li>Change the div with class content for a main element, inside the main change the div for section elements.</li>
    <li>Change de div with class benefits for a aside element.</li>
    <li>Change de div with class footer for el footer element.</li>
</ul><br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements<br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Organized the CSS and add comment.</li>
</ul><br>
WHEN I view the image elements<br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>On the main section and aside section add alt attribute.</li>
</ul><br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes<br>
THEN they fall in sequential order<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Fix heading order</li>
</ul><br>
WHEN I view the title element<br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Fix the title.</li>
